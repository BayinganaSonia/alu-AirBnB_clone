AirBnB clone - The console

Project Description
This project is the first step in building a full AirBnB clone. Where we will create a Python command-line interpreter (console) to manage project objects (User, Place, State, City, Amenity, Review, etc.) and implement a simple file-based storage engine. The interpreter will let you create, show, update, destroy, and list objects as well as serialize/deserialize them to JSON.
